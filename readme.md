# How To Build A #BADA55 NodeJS Dev Environment

A Presentation by Derick Bailey.

## Abstract Things

Everything old is new again! The command line, batch processing, vim... we're circling our own history, coming back to the time when a development environment was little more than a text editor and some command line tools. And why not? The IDEs of today are gigantic, monolithic systems that can easily lock you in instead of opening up new roads like they should.

But I've got a secret for you: there's no need for a bloated IDE taking up gigs of memory! You don't need a $500 software package that doesn't even come with tech support. And code auto-completion? HA! That's for libraries and runtimes so bloated and so complex that you would never be able to read the docs in time to build your app.

We don't need no stinking IDE to build amazing applications with an epic workflow and development environment! We only a text editor, a terminal window and the "npm" command line.

Join Derick Bailey as he shows you how to build your own #BADA55 development environment for NodeJS applications. Run unit tests. Bundle browserify code. Concat and minify CSS. Then, refresh your browser without having to hit the "refresh" button, and more! You'll see how a text editor combined with NodeJS, Nodemon, Grunt, and a handful of command line tools can easily replace that stodgy, cumbersome IDE with something infinitely more flexible and customizable.
