# How To Build A #BADA55 NodeJS Dev Environment

A Presentation by Derick Bailey.

## Abstract Things

Everything old is new again! The command line, batch processing, vim... we're circling 
our own history, coming back to the time when a development environment was little more 
than a text editor and some command line tools. And why not? The IDEs of today are 
gigantic, monolithic systems that can easily lock you in instead of opening up new roads 
like they should.

But I've got a secret for you: there's no need for a bloated IDE taking up gigs of memory! 
You don't need a $500 software package that doesn't even come with tech support. We only need 
a text editor, a terminal window and the "npm" command line.

Join Derick Bailey as he shows you how to build your own #BADA55 development environment 
for NodeJS applications. Run unit tests. Bundle browserify code. Concat and minify CSS. 
Then, refresh your browser without having to hit the "refresh" button, and more! 
You'll see how a text editor combined with NodeJS, Nodemon, Grunt, and a handful of 
command line tools can easily replace that stodgy, cumbersome IDE with something 
infinitely more flexible and customizable.

that I created for my WatchMeCode screencast series. If you'd like to see more detail about any
individual tool that I show in this presentation, please head over to [WatchMeCode.net](http://watchmecode.net) and check
